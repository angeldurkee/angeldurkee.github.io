                    <p>“Flow arts,” as defined by the Flow Arts Institute, describe the intersection of movement-based disciplines such as dance, juggling, fire spinning, and prop manipulation.</p>    
                    <br>
                    <p>Flow arts are growing all the time — constantly cross-pollinating and mixing genres and creating flow arts diversity.</p>

                    <p>The connection of flow arts to body and mind is powerful. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, also known by many as “the Father of Flow,” is a researcher and author in the field of psychology. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>  He defines the Flow as a mental state where a person is completely immersed in a feeling of energized focus, complete involvement, and success in the process of an activity that they're engaged in.</p>

                    <p>There becomes a mind-body balance that's soothing yet energizing. 
                        For some, the flow can become somewhat hypnotic or trancelike. 
                        It's like a motion-based meditation, and while the aesthetic value of flow arts is relatively easy to see, 
                        it also benefits us physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually.</p>

                    <p>Michael Pollan, author of Botany of Desire, explains the flow state as “a kind of transcendence
                         — a mental state of complete and utter absorption well known to artists, athletes, gamblers, 
                         musicians, dancers, soldiers in battle, mystics, meditators, and the devout during prayer.”</p>

                    <p>The flow state heightens your experience, focuses you on the present moment, and abandons all regret and worry.
                         “It is a state that depends on its effect on losing oneself in the moment, usually training a powerful,
                          depthless concentration on One Big Thing.”</p>

                    <p>Ask different people what “flow” means to them,
                         and they might all give you a different answer. 
                         But — at least neurobiologically — we are all 
                         sharing the same feeling of heightened experience.</p>   
                         
                    <br>
                    <p>Flow artists understand that although flow feels natural, 
                        blissful, effortless — at the foundation of every flow 
                        session is months, even years of hard work. In order to 
                        feel at ease with a prop, a flow artist needs to build a 
                        “vocabulary” of movements to pull from during a state of flow. </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This means that they will spend hours deliberately practicing skills,
                         in order to isolate that group of neurons to be strengthened.</p>

                        can change your operating system. It helps us perceive and process more fully. </p>
