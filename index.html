                  “Flow arts,” as defined by the Flow Arts Institute, describe
                  the intersection of movement-based disciplines such as dance,
                  juggling, fire spinning, and prop manipulation.

                  Flow arts are growing all the time — constantly
                  cross-pollinating and mixing genres and creating flow arts
                  diversity.

                The connection of flow arts to body and mind is powerful. Mihaly
                Csikszentmihalyi, also known by many as “the Father of Flow,” is
                a researcher and author in the field of psychology.

                He defines the Flow as a mental state where a person is
                completely immersed in a feeling of energized focus, complete
                involvement, and success in the process of an activity that
                they're engaged in.

                There becomes a mind-body balance that's soothing yet
                energizing. For some, the flow can become somewhat hypnotic or
                trancelike. It's like a motion-based meditation, and while the
                aesthetic value of flow arts is relatively easy to see, it also
                benefits us physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually.

                  Michael Pollan, author of Botany of Desire, explains the flow
                  state as “a kind of transcendence — a mental state of complete
                  and utter absorption well known to artists, athletes,
                  gamblers, musicians, dancers, soldiers in battle, mystics,
                  meditators, and the devout during prayer.”

                  The flow state heightens your experience, focuses you on the
                  present moment, and abandons all regret and worry. “It is a
                  state that depends on its effect on losing oneself in the
                  moment, usually training a powerful, depthless concentration
                  on One Big Thing.”

                    Ask different people what “flow” means to them, and they
                    might all give you a different answer. But — at least
                    neurobiologically — we are all sharing the same feeling of
                    heightened experience.
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Flow artists understand that although flow feels natural,
                    blissful, effortless — at the foundation of every flow
                    session is months, even years of hard work. In order to feel
                    at ease with a prop, a flow artist needs to build a
                    “vocabulary” of movements to pull from during a state of
                    flow.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    This means that they will spend hours deliberately
                    practicing skills, in order to isolate that group of neurons
                    to be strengthened.

                    When I am really flowing, I am performing moves I never knew
                    I had. I am more seamlessly connecting pieces of my
