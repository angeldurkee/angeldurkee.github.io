        <p>“Flow arts,” as defined by the Flow Arts Institute, describe the intersection of movement-based disciplines such as dance, juggling, fire spinning, and prop manipulation. Flow arts are growing all the time — constantly cross-pollinating and mixing genes and creating flow arts diversity. You might see a flow artist juggling, hula hooping, slacklining, or balancing a sword on her head…or perhaps, all of these at the same time.
        </p>

        <p>Michael Pollan, author of Botany of Desire, explains the flow state as “a kind of transcendence — a mental state of complete and utter absorption well known to artists, athletes, gamblers, musicians, dancers, soldiers in battle, mystics, meditators, and the devout during prayer.” The flow state heightens your experience, focuses you on the present moment, and abandons all regret and worry. “It is a state that depends for its effect on losing oneself in the moment, usually training a powerful, depthless concentration on One Big Thing.”
        </p>

        <p>Ask different people what “flow” means to them, and they might all give you a different answer. But — at least neurobiologically — we are all sharing the same feeling of heightened experience.
        </p>

        <p>Flow artists understand that although flow feels natural, blissful, effortless — at the foundation of every flow session is months, even years of hard work. In order to feel at ease with a prop, a flow artist needs to build a “vocabulary” of movements to pull from during a state of flow. This means that they will spend hours deliberately practicing skills, in order to isolate that group of neurons to be strengthened.

                <p> "And so to the modern psychological notion of 'Flow,'' being that the mental state of being completely present and fully immersed in a task - being a strong contributor to creativity. When in flow, the creator and the universe become one, outside distractions recede from consciousness, and one's mind is fully open and attuned to the act of creating. Since flow is so essential to creativity and well-being across many slices of life, it is, I think, important that we learn more about the characteristics associated with flow so that we may all learn how to tap into this precious mental resource of 're-connection.'"</p>

                <p>The connection of flow arts to body and mind is powerful. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, also known by many as “the Father of Flow,” is a researcher and author in the field of psychology. He defines the Flow as a mental state where a person is completely immersed in a feeling of energized focus, complete involvement, and success in the process of an activity that they’re engaged in. There becomes a mind-body balance that’s soothing yet energizing. For some, the flow can become somewhat hypnotic or trancelike. It’s like a motion-based meditation, and while the aesthetic value of flow arts is relatively easy to see, it also benefits us physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually.</p>
